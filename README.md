# Calculator

This program provides the user the ability to make basic calculations just like a calculator.  The calculations available are
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  First the user enters a number then is asked which calculation they want to do,
then the user enters a second number and the program displays the answer.  The program will then ask the user if they want to continue
with more calculations and if not it will end the program.

This program utilizes python functions and conditional statements.  It is a very basic calculator and could be improved by adding functionality
for more complex calculations like exponents and square roots, or being able to do a calculation with more than two numbers at once.
